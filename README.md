## About Me

I am an innovative AI Executive with a proven track record of over 25 years building products and leading high-performance engineering teams.  I walk the fine line between industry and academia, as I am a firmly believer that any academic work shall always have a practical implementation counterpart, and that every industry implementation should benefit from the rigour and discipline of academia.
I am currently wrapping up a PhD in generative AI while working as an AI consultant.
